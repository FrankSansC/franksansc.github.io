# WTF is this all about ?

Good question. I don’t even know myself. It changes so many times that I can’t remember of everything. As every geek does, it all started with a test of every weblog softwares available. Yesterday it was Drupal, then WordPress, today it's Blogger and tomorrow it will be something completely different (maybe some paper sheets and a pencil). Yesterday it was in french (duh!), today it’s in english (I hope so) and tomorrow it will be… well I don’t know any other languages so it will stay in english I think. Or in french.

About the content it will be computer related of course : tips and tricks about Linux/Windows/Palm OS/something-in-between, stuffs about embedded systems (OpenMoko for example), microcontrollers (MSP430 for example) and some others things (for example).

But I must warn you : don’t expect that it’s gonna be interesting, written in proper english with no spelling mistakes and that it will be useful. It’s even safer not to try what I talk about as it will surely cause damages to your computer, yourself and even to your goldfish. So my advice is to leave this website asap and forget everything about it (though it’s not gonna be a hard task).

So you’re still here ? Well, you’re either a bot or some desperated human being. In first case : “just fucking go crawling elsewhere”. In second case : “enjoy your stay”.

Frank.
