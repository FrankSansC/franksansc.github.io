# TODO List
[Last update : 30/03/2010] 

This post is mainly a reminder of what I should do/try when I've got some spare time and the motivation to do it. It will be updated from time to time and stay on top of the home page.

## Ubuntu :
- find out why there’s some much flickering when a software is in full-screen
- post all the tips and tricks I've got

## Windows :
- post a list of all the useful tools I use
- post all the tips and tricks I've got
- post a "how-to" migrate from Thunderbird to Outlook

## Acer Aspire One 150 :
- install Terratec Cinergy XS USB key (A/D TV receiver)
- is there a way to unplug the internal WiFi antenna and plug an external one ? => yes, look here : http://hackaday.com/2009/08/23/aspire-one-external-antenna/

## OpenMoko Neo Freerunner :
- ~~install Debian~~
- ~~find out how to do some war-driving and use the GPS at the same time (idea : wifi google map of the neighborhood)~~ => I'm going to sell my Freerunner as I don't use it anymore. I'll write a post about it but if you're interested you can drop me an email.

## Western Digital Mybook World Edition :
- auto rsync when plugging an USB thumb drive (need to detect the plug-in, to mount the thumb drive, to check if the root directories that must be synchronized exist, to effectively do the sync, to mail the log file)
- UART output
- shutdown hard-drive (and only hard-drive) if not used after some times
- WoL => seems impossible to do :(

## Palm Tréo 680 and Palm related stuffs :
- post a list of all the useful tools I use

## Texas Instruments MSP430 :
- wiki ?
- post all the tips and tricks I've got

## NXP LPC2000 family :
- post all the tips and tricks I've got

## Development :
- learn Python for god sake !
- learn Perl as it sounds fun too !
- create a small calculator that automatically converts any value in hexadecimal, binary, integer, in 8/16/32/64 bits, calculates one’s and two’s complement, displays common mask values, bit-wise operations, etc. Cause I’m really sick of using this piece of sh*t of Window$ calculator (look at the new Windows 7 calculator and its “programmer” mode)

## Blog(ger) :
- Is there an easy way to link one of my own page/post other than copy/paste the link ? (yes I know this one sounds stupid)
- Clean the CSS
- Display a "last update" timestamp whenever a post is... well... updated !

## Other computer-related stuffs :
- install TrueCrypt on my main USB key and make it works flawlessly under Windows & Ubuntu
- ~~IPv6 using Freebox/WRT54GL and dd-wrt (need to update it ?)~~ => don’t use dd-wrt anymore and seems like there’s no other firmware with IPv6 support
- Tinkering, Hacking & Taking apart electronic stuffs :
- post pictures of stuffs I've already taken apart
- post a small tutorial about the Bus Pirate
- trying to fix dead electronic devices (like a MP3 player, a Flash drive, etc.) just for fun :)

## Project's ideas that probably won't see daylight :
- see if it’s possible to transform a USB “Wireless PC Lock” into a 434MHz scanner (at least create a post with some pictures of the inner side of the key)
- build (or buy) an omni WiFi antenna with a good gain and build (or buy) a SMA/BNC adapter
- brightness sensor board combined with a software that would adjust the brightness of a LCD screen based on the ambient brightness
- make/find a small board with a µC to control my washing machine (clock to start the washing, I/O to drive the dashboard, etc.) (yes, that's really a stupid project idea)

## Project's ideas that might see daylight :
- change HDD and battery of my Archos Gmini XS 202s
- discriminator output on Alinco DJ-X3

## Wish-list :
- Shuttle-like computer with HDMI output that can be screwed to my TV’s rear side (VESA mountable case ?)
- Dual 20″ screens and an “Ubuntu-compatible” graphic card with two DVI outputs
- Motorized & WiFi webcam with night vision
- Ultra-flat or ultra-small image scanner
- “Ubuntu-compatible” A4 graphic tablet
- ~~Rigol DS1052E DSO~~ => bought on march 2010
