# I'm back again !

...but for how long ? Only time will tell. So what's new ? Well I'm going to cancel my contract for my dedicated server (I'm paying 30€/month for something I barely use) that's why I'm moving to Blogger. I still need to clean some stuffs but I've almost successfully migrated to this new weblog platform.

What to expect for the near future ? I'm going to publish some old draft posts I've written months (years ?) ago. I've also got some small projects in mind like :
- change the HDD and the battery of my Archos Gmini XS 202². I've already taken it apart, taken some pictures of the inner parts and right now I'm looking for a replacement hard-drive (same characteristics but bigger)
- take apart some other electronic stuffs and post pictures of it, just for fun
- maybe a tutorial about how to install Cyanogen on a HTC Dream phone. I know there's many other tutorials about this but I lost a couple of hours just because of some stupid things so I think it could be nice to share my experience on this subject
- maybe some other Android-related posts but I'm not sure right know as I'm not entirely convinced by this OS. So maybe there will be only one post about why I don't like Android
- maybe a couple of book reviews

Lots of "maybe" isn't it ? That's all for tonight. If you got questions / remarks / project ideas do not hesitate to post a comment or drop an email or send me a tweet.

Cheers.
